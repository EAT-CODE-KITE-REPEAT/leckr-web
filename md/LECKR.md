I can take the LECKR.io stuff and put it all here. Then, add aquisition methods and other stuff for admin only. Stuff that I can talk about to others. 

# KPI

1. Time to market: Same day MVP
2. App Traction
3. Amount of projects
4. Hours worked per week

# Aquisition methods

1. Affiliate 10-50%
2. Super simple onboarding: free apps for big companies, or starting at an MVP for €2000,- that can already make money. 
3. Google Ads

# Sales strategy
Every month, ask for feedback: put blurbs: Ethos.
Send us your offer and we'll see if we can beat it.
Abstract away from $/h, ask money for features

# Mission:
Becoming the Siri for making apps

# Why I can't work per hour
- When I'm programming I often work on 4 apps at the same time. In my mind it's impossible to separate them. 
- In the past I've made stuff that saves me time now
- Now I make stuff that saves me time in the future

# Goal 2019
Earn 10k a month so I don't have to worry about money anymore. Earn it as smart as possible, so don't work that hard, but just make sure I get the right projects.



# LECKR:

LECKR makes it possible to make apps for web, ios, and android very quickly to test a value proposition. It should be doable within a day. That's why the backbone has to be perfect.

With leckr, all strategies and software for execution of them will be thought out, from pre-validation to PoC. The landing page will change in all stages.

Using this library and the documentation around it, you should be able to build an app with all things around it within a few hours, and test the value proposition within a few days.

## Goal

* Know projected Cost Per Install (CPI)
* Know viral reach per install per retention attempt (VRPIPRA)
* Know purchase ratio (CPP)
* Easily A/B test multiple sites
* Optimize to combination of those (modeled out over time and money)
* Test new ideas within a day
* Get feedback before making an app

This is the real µ-Cycle, the hyper sprint to pre-validate ideas super quickly.
After an idea pre-validates, your promise is good enough and you can build a PoC that delivers.
Then, of course, it's still the question wether or not people will actually use it. 
Also, it's a question wether or not people will pay, but you can even test this before making the app!

## Ideal flow of new ideas

Instead of making a new app every time and work 6 months before converting anything, the flow should be more like this:

1) Buy a domain
2) DNS to Surge
3) Define value propositions
4) Create assets for the landing page and FB ads for a few value propositions I want to A/B test. As many as I like. 
5) Create new leckr-landing object and deploy everything
6) Improve the site a bit if necessary (probably not)
7) Post a story on show-hn, indie-hackers, medium, producthunt, etc. Learn from feedback and see how it converts. If feedback is positive and reach is big, continue. Otherwise, go back to 3, or, if nobody wants it at all: quit.
8) Create an Ad on Facebook or Google or even a general App platform like Adjust, that leads to the landing page. Measure everything (CPI, CPP, VRPIPRA).
9) Catch converting pixels, create lookalike audience and target Ad on them. 
10) Measure everything again. Estimate projection of CLV. These stats now are good projectsions of when the app is real. 
11) Model this on time and costs, and see if it's worth a shot.

Of course, you should deliver on the value propositions, so keep it simple. If you do deliver, then you can count on long-lasting users, and then CLV will be very high. It can be huge if people already are willing to pay without using the app. This should always be tried.


# The Stages

* Stage A) Ideas & Conceptualization
* Stage B) Prototype & Pre-Validation
* Stage C) PoC & Validation
* Stage D) MVP & PMF
* Stage E) FiF & Seed
* Stage F) Grow

![Idea to Scale](./idea_to_scale.jpg)

## A) Ideas & Conceptualization (±8h)

The most important step not to skip. Perfection may take up to a few days, but a first version can be made within ±4 hours.

A1) Get ideas

A2) Market research

A3) Discussion with friends

A4) Look if there's demand through sites like Udemy. A course can teach you what people want, if you bring it in an app.
- [Example](https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?src=ukw&q=network+building)
- [Example 2](https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?q=relationship%20building&src=sac&kw=building%20re)

A3) Extensive Lean Canvas (why, how, rough USP definition, virality estimation, marketing estimation, business model, critical mass, chicken and egg estimation, estimated money needed to be viable, sales needed estimation)

Goal: Figure out if it's probably viable

## B) Prototype & Pre-validation (±16h)

If the concept doesn't feel good, quit. If the concept feels and looks good on paper, it's time to prototype & pre-validate. Before making the app, it's important to get some feedback.

B1) Read about techniques that suit validating and prototyping your SaaS product: Examples: [1](https://ryanbattles.com/post/product-validation-techniques) [2](https://briancasel.com/validating-a-saas-product-step-by-step/) and more (search for [SaaS validation](https://www.google.com/search?q=saas+validation&oq=saas+validation&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l2.1416j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).)

B2) Create a landing page, assets and copy for multiple target-audiences and/or varying copy

B3) Set up nice basic landing page funnel "BLPF": Basic landing page -> Email -> Form -> Follow up form -> Status updates
NB: You can also enable pre-launch sharability features and pre-order options, in order to measure CPP and VF

B4) Add Channels that lead early adopters to the BLPF:

- FB, Google & other Ads ($0.01C per view, ±$1-5 per click)
- ProductHunt announcement
- Reddit
- Show HN
- Forums
- Organize or join meetups, events, conferences
- Invite a group of friends for a feedback session

B5) Evaluation: Evaluate KPI's and feedback, tweak website copy, send this to advisors & potential investors.

Goal: at least 100 filled in forms.

## C) PoC & Validation (±80h)

If the ads conversions and form-feedback are promising, continue. Otherwise, go back to the ideas stage, or give up. Now it's time to really spend some time.

C1) Build & test the app myself

C2) Get 4 testers from early adopters that have the right devices (Old & New, iPhone & Android)

C3) Iterate over feedback

C4) Email all early adopters to invite for the BETA

C5) Iterate over feedback again

C6) Measure KPI's (especially retention and virality), possibly by sending a few surveys (for money) or doing this manually

Goal: Lots of feedback and good KPI indication to decide to continue and in which direction

## D) MVP & PMF (±160h and $±10k for Ads)

If users keep using it and it still looks promising, it's time to really make a monetizable product out of this, and invest at least the same $ as your time is worth on advertising to get a little userbase going. 

D1) Define & Build product into a monetizable thing, ready for growth, analytics & virality

D2) Open up the landing page, improve it, continue with ads (#1)

D3) Tweak funnels, try to earn money back

D4) Estimate KPI's, make them promising

Goal: Earn money back as fast as possible, or quit if you figure out you won't

## E) FiF & Seed (±80h)

At this point, you're either deciding to bootstrap or raise money, based on circumstances. Of course, this step can be skipped if you plan to bootstrap for sure. This step almost always overlaps with the previous one.

E1) Show KPI's to potential investors (can also be the crowd)

E2) Talk to many investors

E3) Go with the best deal, or not.

Goal: Get some funding for a bit of equity to be able to grow much faster.

## F) Grow (±∞)

Now, tweaking growth should be the main goal. There are many KPI's for this. Some very interesting ones are the Viral Factor, TTEYMB (Time to earn your money back), and the more famous CAC:CLV ratio. Also, userbase churn should not be forgotten.

At this app, I define what I tell to which circles.
I also define what's secret and what's not. 

[Me, Inner circle, Tribe, Tribe's inner circle, new people.] These are the circles. The website is what's shown to new people. Don't tell too much, just what they need to hear to bring me what I want.

After that, they end up in a smaller and smaller circle, and I will tell them more and more. 

# More info
Until 2016 I've not been making a lot of money with my work, because it was a hobby for the most part and I wasn't that interested in the business aspect. I created (and rewrote 3 times) a text-based online mafia game for about 30.000 players and 600 DAU. For the most part, I worked alone.

Since 2017 I make apps on native mobile or on web.

# Your secret weapon

I am your secret weapon. I can bring the most valuable part and most scarce part of every startup: I possess a good working, simple, elegant, stable product that can be easily deployed for a specific niche of startups. That's why we can make a lot of money together.

I don't just make what you want, because most startups don't know what they really need. Before we start, I already have built-in virality, automation, devops, authentication, security, scalability, and much more.

I've built apps for over 14 years, so I know what I'm doing. That's why I don't listen to you, you can just leave me to it, and sell your idea. I make the product based on the idea. You sell it.

Most startups fail because their CTO's get distracted and don't work hard enough on code quality. Instead, they rush because their CEO wants to pivot every month, and try to keep up with this. They don't see the bigger picture. I've built my current codebase for the past 3 years, and I'm going to keep it for at least another 10. It's not perfect, but it's really good at helping startups get where they want to go. It's good at making a functional prototype (and maybe an MVP in the future). 

All I need is a team to bring this to the world. 

We both want to be succesful, so let's not tell each other what to do, or how to do it. Just talk about the 'why'. 

We can make a lot of money together, so let's get started.

Hey, I'm Wijnand, a serial entrepreneur & CTO.

For the past 14 years, I've been making apps - first on the web, now also on mobile.
Some succeeded, most 'failed' dramatically, but at least it was a fun journey.
