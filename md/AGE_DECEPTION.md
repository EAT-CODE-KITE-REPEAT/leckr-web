Age deception 
- Online, provide faked, older, pictures
- Nowhere it should be possible to see my real age
- In real life, never share my age

Also, be very vague about how many years work and study experience I have had. 
Don’t count years, count experiences.
What if you could calculate anyones age by experiences? That’d be insane if you could measure ‘experiences’ objectively. Or wisdom. It’s another startup idea, and it’s easy to try. One hackathon at a time.
