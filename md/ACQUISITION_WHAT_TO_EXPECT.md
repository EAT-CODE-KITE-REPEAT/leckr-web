#What can you expect from me?

Process to get leads for new freelance projects for the LECKR Agency [printed]

Introduction

- I cold email or approach them with a short intro and ask them to meet
- I approach a company with an idea and ethos/pathos.
- I ask if they would like a prototype (depending on the company, discuss on how much this would cost, ±5000€ minimal, or much more)
- If they trust me, plan another meeting.

Creation of Prototype

- I make a prototype and some wireframes with designs / ideas 
- I bring facts and figures
- I present them this on a meeting

Follow up meeting(s)

- Demonstrate prototype, discuss MVP possibilities

- Discuss business model and how to pay LECKR. Pay for features, pay per active user, a percentage of shares, or hourly rate (with or without code).

MVP

- LECKR makes an MVP (with your feedback) but you don’t get the code and it’s not released, just for people with an invite-code (testers). Price depends on what the company can afford.

- Together, we try it internally and come up with more features or changes

- Together we try to bring this app to profitability (LECKR on the code side, you on the funding and PR side)

- It could be possible to work in my obfuscated codebase so you can work on your own features

Split up

- After the app is profitable or has enough investors, and more man are put on the job of improving it, it could be that LECKR and your startup split up

- I teach you how to work further on this app, provide good documentation, and open up the codebase needed to further improve the app



# What can you expect from me? [printed]

- My goal is to be either one of founder/CTO/CEO of a successful startup in an area that I really like. This has potential. 

- My role could be CTO and oversee process of building a website, app, and doing dev-ops. I also like to learn more about the role of CEO with all the skills that come with that (marketing, sales, talking with investors, pr, cr, etc.)

- I’m in the process of setting up my own Startup App Agency (see https://leckr.io). I don’t know what the definition of an agency is, but I may already have one. 

- I’d like to organise hackathons or sprints for this project on a regular basis. Also, I will work on this project in my free time, alone, from home.

- I prefer to work from HOME or TQ, or at least from Amsterdam. I don’t like trains I don’t like driving, and I certainly don’t like airplanes (something with the environment). Please don’t make me. I’m the most productive from home anyway.

- I don’t know how much time it will take, but I can promise that I can deliver a prototype with the set requirements. If the feedback from investors is positive and we all want to keep going, I’ll deliver an MVP too.

- Prototypes usually can be built within a week (a SPRINT), but due to other projects and feedback/iterations, it’s better to reserve a month time-span.

- MVP’s usually can be built within a month if you do it right (boil it down), but due to other projects and feedback/iterations, it’s better to reserve ±3 months time-span. 

- I work with a certain technology stack that makes a lot possible for mobile and web development, however, not everything can be achieved which could be achieved natively. This is out of my boundaries, so it’s good to discuss future possibilities of the app, and whether or not this would be feasible.

- My IP stays my IP. If I leave, it’s possible to buy my IP for either only the domain your app operates in or for everywhere. Also it’s possible to just buy the app-specific code with the dependencies IP obfuscated, so you can still keep working on your app. 

- I can guarantee that my IP will be maintained for the coming 2-10 years at least because I am continuing to work on this codebase with high certainty and React Native will not go away anytime soon. This means, as long as you I’m part of your startup (or even after my potential leave) the app will be maintained for a long time, if there’s money. 

- If required, I can give an estimate of how much I would sell the whole codebase for (My IP). This is a number meant for the investor, so they know what they’re up against. However, I hope not to have to sell it AT ALL. EVER.

- I want shares and a base salary. Shares can be 10-50% of the company, depending on the work and team-size. Base salary should be €1000-2000 a month. Open to discussion. Post-MVP I prefer to change my shares into a % of the revenue/profit. 

- I work mostly from home or remote, and I don’t work by hour/week. I work by features and deadlines. These deadlines include P, MP, MVP, AVP. Don’t get too specific. 

- I see myself as an artist. I don’t work with specific requirements or designs. I work with a goal, my creativity, and your succinct feedback. This app is my painting. Please acknowledge my artistic creativity and you’ll be happy (I’ll be much more productive). 

- I can join meetings with investors or clients, as long as they’re in Amsterdam. 

- As a bonus: I’d like to organise adventurous events or kitesurfing sessions with lessons included for the team.
