What could I tell investors to convince them to invest in me and maybe advice me on how to bring it to the market?

- Explain why I think it's worth so much
- Explain them I'm not going to tell anything of its internal workings because that's part of the value of it
- Don't say my name because that's also classified

Only talk to investors that do good things. 
Don't talk to immoral investors. Like... AT ALL.



BIGGEST PROBLEM

- Any thing I tell them is worth a lot in itself already. So once I explain them the idea, I'm already losing a lot of money/power/control in the long run. It's all about relative power... They have leverage once they know my idea/plan. 

That's why I shouldn't do it. Like... AT ALL.
Only thing I can ask for is to lend me money without questions. You give me money, I use it wisely. 
They will only believe me then based on past success. 
I can show them my invoices to Dyme and Roadeo, and my past work of apps I've made.

Do this my digital precense is obfuscated. Remove digital precence asap!
