Everything I can't automate for creating parallel apps should be outsourced. 

The most important one is finding funding...

Also things I didn't automate yet will probably have to be outsourced.

Also very custom apps.

Also, networking and meeting should be done by somebody else of the team.

Emails and human communication in general should not go through me.

Branding and public awareness should not include my identity since this seems impossible if I paralellize it. The company LECKR, however, IS possible.

I focus on parallelizable tasks ONLY, so I can produce infinite times as much value per day.

In the beginning, I'd need others. But slowly, I can find automatable ways of doing their tasks.

Keep MM, HM and R happy to get a stable source of income. For the rest, focus on the automatable and the things that are able to be outsourced in a scalable way. 

Design the business in a way that's deceptive and highly scalable.
