[[[ MasterCrimeZ ]]]

Although I'm not going to do anything with MCZ anymore, it's good to utilize my network I still have left and warm them up a bit for anything else. Don't under estimate the value in this!

# Website
- Download source via typeform
- link to app 
- Story (should I post this online, publicly? Will the advantage be greater than the disadvantage?)
- link to karsens.com
- looking for someone that wants to take over this game
- catch emails w/ mailchimp

# App
- Keep it as-is (just iOS)

# Marketing
1. Be able to send 10k+ mails that don't land in spam: Gmass / MailChimp / Sendgrid
2. Get people hyped about the MasterCrimeZ source (website + app!)
3. Grow my network by people that know and adore me (weak links)
4. Direct some of them to my other products
5. Become a MailChimp Master
