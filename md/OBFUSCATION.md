OBFUSCATION

- When working on an app, only that app should be visible, so people can't detect that I work on so many apps. 
Maybe: open the whole codebase, open the app folder on which I'm working

- Obviously, for others to be able to work in my codebase, my own code should be obfuscated. NPM Makes this possible through publishing there but obfuscated. Great. 

- It's a big big problem I'm trying to solve, and once I've solved it... Don't tell anybody anymore. Philipp isn't the smartest guy, I think. Although he studied econometrics, he didn't remember a lot I said. But my ethos wasn't that great though. 


Minimize the known info on the net about me before it's too late
Minimize things people know about me
This is how google works.
It's one big mistery, but you trust it.
Be smart.
Be google.
