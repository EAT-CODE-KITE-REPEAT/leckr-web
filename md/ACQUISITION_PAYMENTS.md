In this document it's assumed that I join an early startup. For example HM or MM, or one that's a bit further like R. It needs to be very clear how I like to work so we don't get unexpected outcomes.

In general: I get paid when you get paid.
- Pay partly if you get funding
- Pay partly revenue, once it hits

Example:

### STAGE 1: Work for the pre-seed

- I join your startup. You have an idea, and a small prototype, but no funding yet.
- I create a way better, functional prototype/minimal product that is able to get some traction. I do this my own way so I can work the fastest and provide the most value in very little time
- You look for pre-seed (±50k€). If we succeed getting a pre-seed, I want to get paid out a bit.

### STAGE 1B: PRE-SEED PAYMENT

- I want an hourly rate for my added work on top of my old codebase. Usually, this is ±€5000,-
- We can make a deal that I keep working for a flat monthly rate and a share in the startup.
- Licence of any obfuscated code (or full IP transfer) not possible yet due to the size of the pre-seed

### STAGE 2: Work for the seed

- I continue to help you get more traction by improving the MP into an MVP
- You look for seed funding for the startup (±500k€). I can help in this process.
- You could help me get seed funding for LECKR too. If I do, this could greatly benefit the code stability and pace of improvements. 
- Once we get the seed, we re-evaluate.

### STAGE 2B: SEED PAYMENT

- ip transfer:  you can buy part of the codebase (fork) so you can completely change it as you wish
- licence:      you can license the codebase so you can build on top of it (dependency)
- rewrite:      you can pay LECKR for work until now and not buy any licence or code, and rebuild it yourself now
- combination:  you can do a combination of ip transfer, licence, and rewrite, to suit your needs

### FURTHER STAGES:
- This is all unknown for me. I've never come this far, so we'll see how it goes, how much we like eachother, and if we want to continue or if we want to split up. I feel like there should be an exit possibility for everyone at every stage, somaybe there is an exit at the seed stage. Since the seed probably doesn't bring enough money on the table to transfer the full IP either (this depends on your app! it may!) it may also be possible for me to become a shareholder so you can get full IP. However, it may also go on the other direction: LECKR may grow in amount of people too. If so, we may want to grow together with you and keep doing what we did before. I know this is very unclear all, but there is really no good way to define anything beyond the seed.


| IP (What part) | Licence price (€/month) | IP Transfer price | LOC | Genius-factor |
