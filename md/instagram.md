Influencia.AI

so many applications for this data
actually it's just the data (which can come from different sources too)
and then it's a dunbar kinda app but it differs what you can do with it per site. 

This is also something that I can really use MYSELF as a start for ANY APP for cold outreach.

Instagram Data (and other sources) --> Local People Database --> Super Casual E-mail, ethos, pathos --> SendGrid Parse API --> Responses --> Sentiment Analytics (yes/no?) --> Second email with logos + appointment + sales 

This is probably a very good and still kinda ethical way of approaching people out of nowhere. It's B2C-ish since influencers are often people, and they have reach TO a lot of people very directly, as opposed to companies. 

This can be my growth hacking strategy!

- pre-release a website with protomouse
- get a list of of 10.000 influencers using Influencia.AI
- send them a casual cold email with ethos, pathos. resend automatically if no response.
- collect response, sentiment analysis (50% x 50% positive = 25% = 2500 leads with potential reach per post (favor) of 300x2500=750000)
- invite them for beta or giving sales or affiliate. Let's say 10% of them does the favor. That's hits 75000 inbound traffic. Let's say 10% convert. That's 7500 downloads, almost no work. If I'd do this, I'd be a very good Growth Hacker. Also Data Scientist, also easily become a Model, an Influencer, and rich. Let's do this.


Kind regards,
