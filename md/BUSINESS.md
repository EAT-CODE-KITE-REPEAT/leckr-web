# Business Development Document

This document is sometimes read by me to iterate on ideas. Sometimes read by others to get feedback. 
Old texts aren't deleted but once a lot has changed, rewritten and put on the bottom. Under every title, the date should be added. This way I get a nice history of the business development of Dunbar.

-------



Verkoop Dunbar as een club voor jou en je 5 beste vrienden. Their Prize? 33% of the company

Market Cap? Hoeveel is jouw sociaal netwerk waard? Dat x 5 miljard x 10 jaar = 120*5*$/month =600billion*monthly fee 
....
6 Trillion?
...
2 trillion for its users? 

Creating investors out of your users gives them inventive to spread the word

Max 12.5% weggeven aan investeerders per ronde = 33% na 3 rondes
Max 20% weggeven aan investeerders per ronde is = 49% na 3 rondes

Seed: Verkoop 12.5% voor 937500, dus 75.000 per %

Market cap is 6 million million, so early investors get 800.000x their money

Dunbar doubles the value you get And give to your friends. What is that worth to you?

# Possible investors


- SMS Network and calling network companies (our app promotes SMS and calling usage, and they will die otherwise, as it moves to internet-only. This could be their last hope). Get statistics about #SMS messages sent using our app, per user, per month
- The government may want to keep data out of the hands of US companies, so flat com over SMS and Calling would be better as this data lies in their hands. The same statistic is relevant.
- Companies that create DumbPhones may be interested as it's a very static social network which doesn't have to be on a smartphone. Sending SMS can be done with dumbphones and a simple chatbot service. 
- Humane Technology Investors: This concept greatly benefits and is deeply rooted in the #humanetech philosophy
- All users can become a micro-investor if they want. Create Crowd Funding Incentive from within the app.


# Competitors or collaborations?

Trevor's the guy with basically the same idea, since 2016. 
LinkedIn says he's working on this since march 2017, so >2 years.
https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevor-coleman-toronto?trk=org-employees_mini-profile_title
He probably doesn't do it fulltime, as it's not ready yet. 


fuck! 

seems to be a very small product, but it's certainly in the same area, named after robin dunbar.
figure out the legal implications

we can also collaborate and I could be the front for them; because they are niched down to people with ADHD. therefore, it's not as bad at all.

ask: 
- natasha
- berlin thailand lawyer guy

If he registered the company in just canada, there may still be a possibility that I can roll it out everywhere else, except in canada. But I want to know if this is really possible first.

There are a lot of companies called Dunbar since it's a widely used surname in English countries.
https://www.wipo.int/branddb/en/ --> search dunbar
https://trademark-search.marcaria.com/en/Result?trademark=dunbar&country=US&status=1&mode=1

There are a lot of people in London with the surname Dunbar,

https://www.thephonebook.bt.com/Person/PersonSearch/?Surname=dunbar&Location=london&Street=

And of course, I can still collaborate with Robin Dunbar, if the other guy didn't.
First, I should meet Robin and see how he lives. Is he a very capitalistic person? Or does he not mind a lot about money, like a real scientist? Because maybe, he'd have a good claim on a percentage of the company... Since we named it after him and his theory.
But maybe, he doesn't mind and he'd be flattered and honoured?

Would it be the right strategy to go to him and meet him and tell him all about it? Or would it be better to leave him in the dark? Tough choices! At least, it'd be good to know more about him.

Seems to be the thing he spends most his time on, because it looks way better.

# Competitors

## getdunbar.com
PRM for ADHD (see #18 )

## nat-bot.com
Messenger bot for relations (Don't think it syncs with your contacts, should be tested)

## monicahq.com
Web app, without a way to import contacts easily. Very bad. No competition at all

## contactspls.com
Android Only. But it does it very well. Good design, mostly. Isn't possible with Expo. But this is a general purpose contact app. It's just downloaded so much since it's free anyway and it looks nice.

## UpHabit
Biiiiiig competitor! Seems like a funded startup. It's built by a serial entrepreneur, who probably knows what he's doing. 12 people work there, it seems. However, the app isn't 100% perfect. Lots of things can be done better. For example, it has no ratings in the appstore! Just 3 on Android. So it's either rather unpopular, or they don't ask you for it. 

My impression:
- Good onboarding
- Nice design, but slightly overdeveloped lol
- After import, it's not clear what I should do.
- Sooo many features. It's totally overdeveloped. The most important things that I have in my app are way harder to find here. I wonder who uses this. Probably only entrepreneurs. Maybe nobody at all. Haha.... I think they really fucked up. It's hard to say, but I think it doesn't have a lot of users yet. I think they're still finding the PMF, which they can't find since they should start over with the simple basics.

Yesterday I got frightened when I saw their team. 12 people! But this is probably their problem; they have 4 mobile engineers instead of 1. They have so many features! They definitely have a lot of programming power, but they don't focus on the USP. The app is complex and this probably means a big big big churn for new users. 

They also don't do virality well. There is a share button, but nobody is doing that. It should be an automatic thing that just happens.

Well, I shouldn't be too afraid of them. They look really good at the front, but they fail to deliver and retain their users. It's a bit like Bencompare, it seems. Just throw money at some random developers and expect a miracle to happen. There is no clear vision, probably. 

It's too far away from the normal contact app! 

This is probably developed by following feedback of your users. I think this could be a big pitfall actually! This is interesting! Isn't this the same reason that I was overdeveloping mastercrimez? So many features, but I only listened to my existing userbase. I didn't look at the way new users interacted with the app at all! This seems also how they are doing. After  using the app for a while....You get used to it and you can handle those features, but as a new user, it should be simple! There is a huuuuuge problem with their app, and that's the learning curve. 

I should focus on an easy to understand app. That's my unfair advantage. That's my main distinguishment. New users instantly understand my app, and that makes it useful. 

For now, don't look at competitors anymore, I'm not convinced it'll be hard to find a niche (which can be rather big, rather easily). Just make what I want & what I believe in!


# Purple Cow strategy

Ideas:

- Create an [animation](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-animatable) of overview screen bubble-heads that makes them bounce to each other or something, or maybe make them appear and disappear randomly (like real relationships also have their ups and downs). A cool and pleasant effect should happen when the user didn't do anything for >10 seconds or so. This may occur, for example, when the user lies the phone on the table. Other people around him may already notice the app, but will find it very cool and ask 'what's that' when they see the cool effect. This sparks conversation

-  Shake to connect or tap 3 times to connect will send another person your contact information over NFC or AirDrop or whatever. Even when you just send it by SMS, creating an additional 'tap-requirement' will make it look cool, even when it has no function. This will spark conversation.


- Get access to and send location data to the backend when the user has the app open. Then, make it possible to connect with another user by both shaking your devices at the same time. [use shake algorithm with the agglerometer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2317428/how-to-refresh-app-upon-shaking-the-device). Can be done in Expo. This is a very cool and visual way of connecting. You put the phones on each other and shake them. Then it kind of feels like magic and gives the contact info to each other. Awesome! 


- Creating an online profile of yourself with your 'communication preferences' will be cool because it can be shared (for example, on fb as website). However, it will even be easier to share if there will be a feature called 'quit social media' that generates a profile picture for you based on your 'communication preferences'. This picture contains all your contact information that you want to share there (and a small logo of Dunbar). It would be perfect if this could be generated on the front-end. However, there may also be API's (or a backend is fine too). I should think more about this because it will be a very viral feature but it should really have some added value.

- Having infographics of your relations after a while (like bar-graphs or so) based on the amount and type of interaction will be very insightful and shareable content to some users. If these can be created on the frontend (which they can), we should definitely try this.

- Dropshipping a fashion wearable of Dunbar will be cool because it could become a brand of people that believe in real interaction over flat comm. This could also involve NFC component to make it functional (but isn't needed). This'll spark conversations!



# Pricing


What if our goal wasn't just to show you what we can show you with the app, but also give personal relational advice? We'd be a personal relation coach. Based on your goals and communication data, we recommend events and activities to do with your friends, network, and new people. Also, we try to pinpoint the most toxic and most beneficiary relationships. This is very hard advice to give and very personal. It will probably cost a lot of time to retain this information and to explain it to the customer. For a small userbase, this is impossible to automate. Therefore, we need to smart small and expensive. The relation coach for the higher segment in the market. 

But, in the future, it can definitely be (semi)automated, and then we can target a bigger piece of the market. 

In the higher price segment there are also more influential, smart, and people with bigger goals. This aligns very well with the background of the app. It's also a very good and common strategy to focus on the high-end first. It makes people want it, although it's unattainable for them yet. This is one of the reasons Tesla is so successful and is going to stay successful in the future. Although most people didn't pay for one yet (because they can't), they still want one. When it becomes more feasible in the future, they will buy one.  It doesn't work the other way around. If you aim for the mass-market, rich people will never want your product. It won't ever become a status symbol. 

What if Dunbar VIP would compete with the psychologist, health coach, life coach, relation coach, etc? Or even better: what if we would complement each other? Dunbar provides great data and makes it more reachable (for example, one month for free). Real coaches look at this data and find problems and opportunities for individuals. In later stages, Dunbar looks at the patterns and commonalities between these findings and tries to automate parts of them, so the product requires less labor, and can become cheaper.

**What about this price-point?**

**Dunbar Free** = Free, but up to 12 contacts
**Dunbar Club** = €99,95 one-time fee, or €9,95 a month. Up to 42 contacts
**Dunbar Pro** = €99,95 per month. Up to 150 contacts. Many insights. A little bit of real advice over phone calls
**Dunbar VIP** = €499,95 per month. A team of people looks for people you should connect with. They spend up to 2 hours a week helping you become successful. That's 15 minutes per day.
**Dunbar for Conferences and Events** See #36 

**SALE OPTION 1** You can invite your 3 best friends for 50% cheaper. If you did this, yours will also become 50% cheaper, forever. A year later, you can invite up to 12 friends for this. If you did this, this will make yours free. After one month, you can decide if you want to continue or not-good-money-back.

**SALE OPTION 2** Pay 100%. People that get invited by you get 3 months free trial of whichever subscription you're on. Every invite you send that results in a download, will up your possible contacts amount.


# Masterplan (Elon Style) of 2019 - 2024 (5-year plan)
1. **May 2019** Create a free beta version for my friends and virality to further improve the app. Also, check all B2C channels and their potential to convert. Possibly change the plan after this.
2. **August 2019** Create a high-end, low-volume app for entrepreneurs & early adopters in the high price segment. Put much effort into selling for a high price, and create incredible value & be able to prove this. 
3. **August 2021** Use that money to make the app work for people with mental health issues at a lower price.
4. **August 2023** Use that money to make the app for all market segments, at an incredibly affordable rate.

Initial Stage:

- [ ] Sprint #6 ... create an insightful contact app with some graphs
- [ ] Create screens for all Amsterdam coaches and CoachList.co stating we are not associated, just a coaches directory...
- [ ] Speak with a handful of 'life coaches'. See if we can find collaboration on an affiliate basis (and if they allow this)
- [ ] Talk to them: would this type of data be useful for their coaching?

Later stage:

- [ ] Talk to them about the value proposition and the price-point
- [ ] See which data they'd need to find problems and opportunities for a client. See which data I can get them.
- [ ] Find more high-end people and tell them the value proposition, find out if they'd be interested, and for how much. 
- [ ] Get the price-point right, and launch, collaborating with at least one life-coach so they can provide manual value until I replace parts of them. Price stays the same if people like it.


# Dunbar for conferences and events

Cost: One-time fee of 10% of the average event price. E.g. for TNW this would be €30x2000=€60.000,- 
Why so much? Well, think about how much value it adds to the end-user of the conference. Therefore, they can increase the price by this amount of value. It could even be 50% because I really think that it can easily double the perceived conference value, but the real long-term ROI of users will be exponentially bigger.

For this, the event/conference gets a link they can send to their customers where they can fill in their contact info, professional skills, and goals. This will all end up on a site only those people have access to that have the link. Also, the info gets added to their Dunbar app. This way, you can filter through people that participate at the conference, so you can prioritize who to speak to. 

In the future, AR and face recognition cameras on your AR and on Cameras in the conference halls will make it possible to find people you prioritized more easily.

One problem: conferences may choose not to share all contact info of participants with their participants because this is data they can earn money on, and it will drop the perceived value of a next conference after this one because people have the contact info of everyone already anyway. A change in their business model may be required.

I'm not improving life, but improving relationships and thereby improving life, because I believe this makes the biggest impact. Not setting goals. Not creating habits. Just doing the right activities, and connecting with the right people, for the right reasons. 
- **Contacts+** | [CrunchBase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/contacts) | raised 1.1M$ | 500k downloads/month (but probably tough to make money of them)

- **UpHabit** [CrunchBase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/uphabit#section-overview) | 12 people in Team (could be freelancers) | No funding, but built by serial entrepreneur | Focuses on the habit of staying in touch and creating better relationships. App is crappy and overdeveloped. See #32 and #18 

I don't even know if the name 'Dunbar' is good if I'd pivot to this. But the core could still be the same. Activity&communication analytics was already on my roadmap. Goals was also already on my roadmap. Education wasn't but it can easily be added, based on your goals (and even provide an affiliate business model)

Anyway, I think there's a lot of interest in this for sure. I've also seen incredible personal results because of the lifestyle changes I've made. And I don't even have a personal coach. It's about the friends you make and connect with on a deeper level. 

There should be one app that leads you to do the same.

_Dunbar - Supports you to become brilliant and successful, and support your friends doing the same._

Other categories could also be added. In the end, it's a simple form. I could easily make a form that makes the forms. No problem. 

Easy things to add:

- [ ] EmojiSheet structured, daily, diary
- [ ] Other success things and good things to track
- [ ] More extensive goal setting (goal categories and time-indications) see picture below:

Dunbars Limit (150) is the limit of maintainable stable relationships. Most people have more, but very sparsified relationships. This degrades them.

Our app lets you:
- Organize your network based on importance: the inner circle, friends, and the outer circle.
- Analyze your relational activity so you can see where to improve


According to Dunbar, the limit of active stable relationships is 150. (Managing and limiting your active relationships to 150 people is an enormous task) With Dunbar, we help you to organize, analyze and improve your personal and professional relationships.

# Path to Customers : B2B

_29 april 2019_

--------------


See the masterplan in #35 

To start at the highest price segment, I need to work together with life & business coaches to maximize user value. This will create something people will want and people will show off and brag about. Make them proud users and loyal customers. Getting this right may take a few years. 

Facebook ads aren't going to cut it. At such a high price-point (€250 - €500 euro) we need to do sales. B2B could work because one sale will have a bigger impact and it will be easier to find leads. Collaborate with corporations and business coaches. Sell it as an app that will provide better mental health for employees with business coaching baked in. It can be the main strategy for improving a lot of things. 

Of course, people should also be able to buy this as an individual, it's a personal app. This will be able for €100 a month without coaching (with a possible 50% sale on invitation).

But to make bigger deals, I should just start by selling it as packages. For example for €100,- a month per employee. This will include a bit of coaching. Life/business coaches can also use it for their clients. This should cost ±€20/month per client, and doesn't include coaching. 

In the beginning, the userbase must remain small, and we should do some iterations to improve the app. Of course, companies can go on trial first. I can start asking DYME, MYPO, DEX, etc. I can network to find salespeople that will approach more companies (not as an employee, but as affiliate ambassador)




# Time management 

_5 juni 2019_

Het is inmiddels 37 dagen later sinds de vorige business dev issue.


I've done a lot of thinking about Business development in March and April. In May, there has been written down way less about business (only on the website and in code comments maybe). This is good: I need to focus on the app quality first. Use it myself for a while without bugs. Be happy with it and its simplicity. Then start selling. That's my business strategy now.

In the README I keep and structure more wisdoms about workflow and time management. I strongly believe in not having to find funding, not having to look at competitors and not even thinking about business strategy that much. I believe that if I truly solve my own problem, people will love it. That's a pretty good strategy, I think. 


# iOS 13 preparation

_11th of June, 2019_

https://medium.com/fast-company/apple-is-designing-for-a-post-facebook-world-2edb655e917e?MGa=true

June 3: iOS 13 beta 1 and first look at WWDC 2019
July: iOS 13 public beta release date for adventurous testers
Early September 2019: iOS 13 Golden Master (final dev beta)
Mid-September 2019: iOS 13 likely to launch with new 2019 iPhones

---

Sick. M'n idee staat natuurlijk live sinds maart, dus apple kan er best oren naar hebben gekregen inmiddels. Wie weet. Dit betekent dat ik en Apple dezelfde kant op denken, wat goed is. Dit betekent ook dat sommige features die ik wilde maken misschien gewoon ingebakken gaan worden in iOS/MacOS. Dit betekent dat mijn app waarde verliest op iOS en dus interessanter is voor Android. 

Desalniettemin is het zeer interessant om toch voor apple te kiezen en maximaal te focussen op iOS. Misschien zelfs vooruit lopen op de Expo SDK mogelijkheden en toch Ejecten naar iOS Native. Hierdoor krijgt Apple meer interesse in mijn app, en wie weet kan ik ooit hun als investeerder krijgen (of worden overgekocht). 

Vooral hun notes feature is heel nice van ze. Dat is de andere kant op. Maar het gaat ongetwijfeld ook geintegreerd worden met Siri etc, en dus het 'FIRST people THEN apps PRINCIPLE' lijken ze ofwel zelf bedacht ofwel gejat te hebben. 

Misschien zijn mijn blogs wel gelezen door een insider in Apple of heeft iemand de informatie doorgespeeld.

Misschien moet ik iets meer achter de schermen verschuiven omdat ik al eruit geconcurreerd kan worden nog voordat ik live ben... Dat zou jammer zijn.

Aan de andere kant... Een meer relations-driven OS betekent misschien ook meer mogelijkheden, natively. Dat is super interessant.

Echter kan het ook betekenen dat ze vol gaan voor een sociaal netwerk en dus alle informatie over contacten gaan afschermen, net als Facebook. Dat zou het einde betekenen voor Dunbar op iOS. Dit kan snel gaan! Blijf daarom lean, en maak mezelf niet afhankelijk van Apple only. 

Ongetwijfeld werkt Apple aan veel meer dingen tegelijkertijd, en kan ik in m'n eentje in een korte periode veel meer doen. Maar dit is wel erg spannend, en ik moet het echt in de gaten houden. Ook iOS13 zeker DIRECT testen, for sure. Het gaat ook ongetwijfeld problemen opleveren voor de werking met de contacten api (en nieuwe mogelijkheden)... Dus hier moet snel op gehandeld worden. De beta is maar een korte periode van kracht. 

P.S. it's probably a good idea to network more with apple and let them know more about the idea. Or isn't it?
It depends. Maybe they're already having their eyes on me. 
Maybe not. 
Well, I could play the same strategy. 
Therefore, it's not a bad idea to travle to SF sometime. 

# Whitelabel 100%

I've made this idea earlier. Dunbar should be the core of any other app and it should be easy to build on top of Dunbar, even for others. But first, it'd be a very good idea to make it easy for ME to build on top of Dunbar. To make clear different  value propositions that can be made within Dunbar but would fall under all other possibilities and you won't see the trees through the forest. 

I need whitelabel dunbar core. I can make an app a day on top of this. Actually, Dunbar + Communify is best. It'll easily be possible. To make a good functioning product, it'll probably take me a few more months. 

It's always a struggle. Do I start making apps for others (LECKR) or do I make cool apps for myself first and see if my friends like it? Its inevitable that I can create something valuable but I need money. Obviously, it's not black & white. 

There are 30 days in a month. 

I need to decide what's important, divide my time on this percentage wise. Then declare days in which I do what. 

I think LECKR is a very profitable path. However, Dunbar might be even more profitable. All other ideas I have might be even more profitable. I just have to get better in creating more apps, quicker. This is the most valuable path in the long run. 

Maybe I should go fully 50/50. This seems a good path for now.
There are 168 hours in a week. 730 in a month.
That'd mean 45 hours a week improving my whitelabel product, 45 hours Dunbar. Yes?
Well, my whitelabel product and Dunbar are the same thing. But let's say I've got 90 hours a week. How much time do I spend on calling people? 

I got 100% of 90 hours to work. This is 100% of my work-time. 

20% aquisition & administration seems good, so lets say I should do this 18 hours a week
20% conceptualization & planning seems good, so lets say I should do this 18 hours a week
60% programming seems good, so lets say I should do this 54 hours a week

Evenings are though and programming is tough so lets not do them together. Lets spend evenings on aquisition, administration, conceptualization and planning. This can be done 6 nights a week. There must be one night a week where I still program: The Hackathon. 

What do I spend my time on when programming. Well, over 80% in the code editor is possible. That's over 42 hours. But inside the code editor... what? 

There is: 

- Planning
- Cleaning
- Dunbar
- Dyme
- Roadeo
- LECKR
  
Lots of choices.

I think I should focus on finishing something, general purpose code, and in general always do what I like the most at that moment. My key performance indicator: Amount of finished products per month. Now, this number is incredibly low. 0. Let's pump it up. Smaller projects. Better validation. Let's go from 0 to 1. 12 startups in 12 months. I already did 3 this year, roadeo is number 4. Let's make it 12 in 2019, and finish them.

Let's work for 27 hours a week on other startups (slowly improving the whitelabel product), 30% of my time. Since 50% of my code already is made for the things I can find... I can earn 150 an hour, easily (if I am focused).

This means, I can earn €17350 a month if I have enough projects. I can easily hire someone full-time if I make this work. I just need someone to start part time. Ask friends. They can do the outreach of this agency. They can do sales. 

This also means that I now earn 20% of my potential that is easily reachable. Therefore, spending more than half of my time on aquisition seems reasonable. However, if I don't like to do it, it may be hard. Thus, maybe I need someone that wants to do it together with me. I still want to learn it, but together. 

I just need to find a few more projects like Roadeo and I can start doing this. Do I? I can pay someone to do sales part-time, together with me, in the evenings or in a boat.. 

Basically the fun thing is this work can be done from your phone, in the park, or on a boat. Boattrip Aquisition Day (BAD). Aquisition, planning, conceptualization, validation are all perfect activities to do on a boat. You just need your phone to do it and a few papers/whiteboards maybe. But most of all, you need people. 

WTF lol. So much work can be done from a boat. Callcenter on a boat. Sales on a boat. Marketing on a boat (FB ads). Setting up meetings from a boat. Anything. From a boat. The cancels are my office. Only programming happens inside. Programming can be minimized. Reading can be done outside. 

Work on a boat. Enjoy life. Every sunny day, 3-8, is enough to handle this kind of work with some people. We can even drink beer (or champagne) while doing it. Chicks will love it too. We can even invite random people. Spending a day on a boat where others work for free seems like a good deal to me. And eventually, you'll help them and also call a few companies... after you understand stuff and had a few drinks. 

Fuck it. 

Buy a boat. Fast. Or just rent it on a monthly basis, black. Talk to people on boats to get one. 

BAD : Boating aquisition day

# How many people do I wish to work with?

I work with Valentin, Philipp, Arnoud, Yilong, Jonathan, Bernd, Mike, and a few others. I want to go to a situation in which I know just 33 people very well (see them every day) and work with them. Unfortunately, we are very far from the truth. Just Philipp lives nearby, all others live far away. Who do I share intelectual property with? Just MatchMaker, HealthMonkey, OVFiets, Roadeo, and Jona knows quite well what I do too. This is already quite much. Maybe Martijn did preselection for me, but they were easy to find. Probably my funnel is quite simple. If I was even more business, I would also work with Niels. I would try to find more people in TQ. Lars, for example, too, could easily provide me with a lot of money. See how far away everyone lives? Too damn far. At least, in TQ, there's a lot of talent, really closeby. And it's an underestimated thing. Nobody is seeing this. Therefore, it's a secret. And it probably is kept secret. For a good reason. Because they can earn money. Whoever earns the money from this will be mad once an app opens up the secret. Very mad. But I can try. If you find the secret of someone elses business, and you can change it with ease, it's also a way to make money. It's blackmail. Or it's just doing someones work better. I bet that working purely from TQ (or a similar space) would make me much more lean. Having everyone nearby. Being able to organise hackathons easier and easier. Today it's some day. I don't know which one. But that's not important. All that matters, is I am smart in who I do business with and whom I don't. For example, Mike. Does he want to? Bernd, is he valuable? Common. Well, at least Bernd is LECKR material. But yeah.... Be conscious of this. This may be the most important aspect of my business. The people I surround myself with. 

Your business is:
- The 5 people you surround yourself with
- The 5 information sources you process
- The 5 ingredients you use the most
- The 5 hours you sleep

5x5x5x5 = 625. 6+2+5=13. False is true. 13=33!!!!!!!1. Yes. No. Abra. Pickachu. Alakazam!!!!! 
Funny is stupid. Stupid is good. Good is power. 
Stupid is funny. Funny is good. Good is money. 
Remember the ! rule 
1! = 1      = 1
2! = 2x1    = 2
3! = 3x2x1  = 6
4!          = 24
5!          = 120
6!          = 720
7!          = 5040
8!          = 40320

This if I just have 5 ingredients, there are 720 recipies. I can try one recipe per day and still it will take two years. 

What if my KPI's are my ingredients?

- LOC/Value
- WakaTime hours
- Number of projects operational
- Quality of people
- Autonomy/freedom
- Promise-Result ratio
- Being in charge/being charged ratio
- Fun, excitement, humour.

What if I added one KPI to that.
What if I were like Doodle man? Repeat myself so that I'm extremely fast!
What if you would never look op old code? 
What if you would never write new code?

Wow that time goes fast. I'm awaka for an hour, just wrote some text.... DAMNIT. s
Anyway. Keep boiling it down to the crucial, forget all else, and go for it, 100% autonomously.
